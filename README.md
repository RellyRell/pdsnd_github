### Description of Project
In this project, I utilized data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

I used the imported data from each city to answer questions and provide statistical data.

### Files used
Files for data include:
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- chicago.csv
